    <h1>THE TIME MACHINE</h1><br><br>
    <br>
    <p>The Time Machine, first novel by H. G. Wells, published in book form in 1895. The novel is considered one of the earliest works of science fiction and the progenitor of the “time travel” subgenre.


        Morlocks in The Time Machine
        The Morlocks in The Time Machine (1960), directed by George Pal.
        SUMMARY: Wells advanced his social and political ideas in this narrative of a nameless Time Traveller who is hurtled into the year 802,701 by his elaborate ivory, crystal, and brass contraption. The world he finds is peopled by two races: the decadent Eloi, fluttery and useless, are dependent for food, clothing, and shelter on the simian subterranean Morlocks, who prey on them. The two races—whose names may be borrowed from the biblical Eli and Moloch—symbolize Wells’s vision of the eventual result of unchecked capitalism: a neurasthenic
         upper class that would eventually be devoured by a proletariat driven to the depths.</p>
